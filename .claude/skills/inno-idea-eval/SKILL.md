# inno-idea-eval

## Canonical Summary

Multi-persona idea evaluation with quality gate. Evaluates ideas across 5 InnoEval dimensions (Clarity, Novelty, Validity, Feasibility, Significance) using 3 reviewer personas and a meta-review. Sits between inno-idea-generation and inno-c...

## Trigger Rules

Use this skill when the user request matches its research workflow scope. Prefer the bundled resources instead of recreating templates or reference material. Keep outputs traceable to project files, citations, scripts, or upstream evidence.

## Resource Use Rules

- Read from `references/` only when the current task needs the extra detail.

## Execution Contract

- Resolve every relative path from this skill directory first.
- Prefer inspection before mutation when invoking bundled scripts.
- If a required runtime, CLI, credential, or API is unavailable, explain the blocker and continue with the best manual fallback instead of silently skipping the step.
- Do not write generated artifacts back into the skill directory; save them inside the active project workspace.

## Inputs

Paths for `Ideation/ideas` and `Ideation/references` come from **`instance.json`** (`instance.Ideation.ideas`, `instance.Ideation.references`). They are **absolute** in Dr. Claw-created projects; use as-is. If relative, resolve with `path.join(project_path, value)`.

| Parameter            | Required | Description |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| `selected_idea`      | Yes      | The idea to evaluate, read from `Ideation/ideas/selected_idea.txt` |
| `references`         | No\*     | Pre-formatted string listing all source papers (from inno-prepare-resources) |
| `prepare_res`        | No\*     | Full text response from the Prepare Agent (selected repositories and reasoning) |
| `download_res`       | No\*     | Result log from downloading arXiv paper sources |
| `data_module`        | No\*     | The imported metaprompt module (provides `TASK` field describing the ML task) |
| `context_variables`  | Yes      | Shared context dictionary (must contain `final_selected_idea_data`) |

\*Standalone mode: only `selected_idea` required; evaluation proceeds ungrounded with a noted limitation.

## Outputs

| Output                                         | Description |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `eval_report`                                  | Full markdown evaluation report (meta-review) |
| `eval_scores`                                  | Structured JSON: per-dimension, per-persona, aggregated |
| `eval_decision`                                | One of: `strong_accept` / `accept` / `borderline_accept` / `borderline_reject` / `reject` |
| `eval_feedback`                                | Strengths/weaknesses/suggestions (for refinement or downstream) |
| `context_variables["idea_evaluation_result"]`  | Complete structured result dict |

## Cache file outputs

Each step produces **two kinds** of files:

1. **`.txt` files** (primary) -- the full markdown content of each review, written directly to `Ideation/ideas/`
2. **`.json` files** (derived) -- structured metadata under `Ideation/ideas/logs/`, whose text fields **must be copied verbatim** from the corresponding `.txt` files (never summarized)

### Full directory layout

```
Ideation/ideas/
├── novelty_grounding_report.txt                ← Step 0.5: Active Novelty Verification report
├── eval_report.txt                             ← Step 4: full meta-review report (markdown)

    └── idea_eval_agent_meta_review.json        ← Step 4: Aggregated decision + full report
```

### Write order (critical)

For every step, **always write the `.txt` file first**, then build the `.json` file by copying the `.txt` content into the appropriate field:

For the novelty verification step:
1. Write `novelty_grounding_report.txt` with the full novelty analysis report
2. Copy that full text into `report_text`
3. Write `logs/idea_eval_agent_novelty.json`

For each persona review:
1. Write `eval_persona_{N}_review.txt` with the agent's full review
2. Read it back (or keep in memory) and embed the full text into `review_text`
3. Write the corresponding `logs/idea_eval_agent_persona_{N}.json`

For the meta-review step:
1. Write `eval_report.txt` with the agent's full meta-review report
2. Copy that full text into `report_text`
3. Write `logs/idea_eval_agent_meta_review.json`

### `.txt` file naming

| Step | File name | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Novelty verification | `novelty_grounding_report.txt` | Active Novelty Verification report |
| Persona 1 review | `eval_persona_1_review.txt` | Full markdown review from Senior ML Researcher |
| Persona 2 review | `eval_persona_2_review.txt` | Full markdown review from Domain Expert |
| Persona 3 review | `eval_persona_3_review.txt` | Full markdown review from Methods Specialist |
| Meta-review | `eval_report.txt` | Full markdown meta-review report |

### `.json` file naming

| Step | File name | Key fields |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Novelty | `idea_eval_agent_novelty.json` | search_config, queries, novelty_threat_level, report_text |
| Persona 1 | `idea_eval_agent_persona_1.json` | persona, scores, review_text |
| Persona 2 | `idea_eval_agent_persona_2.json` | persona, scores, review_text |
| Persona 3 | `idea_eval_agent_persona_3.json` | persona, scores, review_text |
| Meta-review | `idea_eval_agent_meta_review.json` | aggregated_scores, decision, report |

### `.json` file format (each persona)

Each file contains `context_variables` only (no messages). The `review_text` field holds the **full text** copied from the corresponding `.txt` file:

```json
{
  "context_variables": {
    "ideas_path": "<instance.Ideation.ideas>",
    "references_path": "<instance.Ideation.references>",
    "persona": "senior_ml_researcher | domain_expert | methods_specialist",
    "scores": {

      "feasibility": { "score": 0, "reason": "...", "references": [] },
      "significance": { "score": 0, "reason": "...", "references": [] }
    },
    "strengths": [],
    "weaknesses": [],
    "suggestions": [],
    "recommendation": "Accept|Reject|...",
    "review_text": "<FULL text from eval_persona_{N}_review.txt>"
  }
}
```

### `.json` file format (meta-review)

```json
{
  "context_variables": {
    "ideas_path": "<instance.Ideation.ideas>",
    "references_path": "<instance.Ideation.references>",
    "aggregated_scores": {
      "clarity": { "avg": 0, "scores": [0, 0, 0] },
      "novelty": { "avg": 0, "scores": [0, 0, 0] },
      "validity": { "avg": 0, "scores": [0, 0, 0] },
      "feasibility": { "avg": 0, "scores": [0, 0, 0] },
      "significance": { "avg": 0, "scores": [0, 0, 0] }
    },
    "overall_avg": 0,
    "decision": "strong_accept|accept|borderline_accept|borderline_reject|reject",
    "report_text": "<FULL text from eval_report.txt>",
    "strengths": [],
    "weaknesses": [],
    "suggestions": [],
    "idea_evaluation_result": { "...complete structured result..." }
  }
}
```

### `.json` file format (novelty verification)

```json
{
  "context_variables": {
    "step": "novelty_verification",
    "search_config": {
      "num_queries": 4,
      "sources": ["arxiv", "semantic_scholar", "openalex"],
      "max_results_per_query": 10,
      "year_from": "<current_year - 3>"
    },
    "queries": [
      { "type": "core_method", "query": "...", "rationale": "..." },
      { "type": "problem_domain", "query": "...", "rationale": "..." },
      { "type": "key_component", "query": "...", "rationale": "..." },
      { "type": "broad_approach", "query": "...", "rationale": "..." }
    ],
    "idea_summary": "...",
    "search_results": { "total_raw": 0, "total_unique": 0 },
    "triage": [
      { "title": "...", "year": 0, "relevance": "high|medium|low|irrelevant", "is_inspiration_source": false, "assessment": "..." }
    ],
    "detailed_analysis": [
      { "title": "...", "year": 0, "overlap": "...", "differences": "...", "threat_level": "..." }
    ],
    "novelty_threat_level": "critical_overlap|high_overlap|moderate_overlap|low_overlap|novel",
    "genuine_novel_contributions": ["..."],
    "report_text": "<FULL text from novelty_grounding_report.txt>",
    "fast_fail_triggered": false,
    "user_decision": null
  }
}
```

- `review_text` and `report_text` must contain the **complete** markdown from the `.txt` file -- never a summary or abbreviation.
- **IMPORTANT**: Each persona `.json` grows independently; the meta-review `.json` aggregates all three.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Step 0 -- Assemble Evidence

> Full template: [`prompts/build_evidence_assembly.md`](prompts/build_evidence_assembly.md)

Read existing pipeline artifacts and compose 3 evidence blocks (one per persona knowledge level):

| Persona Knowledge | Evidence Included |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `high` (Senior ML) | All papers + LaTeX sources + all repos + full task context |
| `medium` (Domain Expert) | Paper titles/abstracts + repo descriptions + task context |
| `medium` (Methods Specialist) | Repo code + paper titles + implementation details |

Sources: `Ideation/references/papers/`, `Experiment/code_references/`, `references` string, `prepare_res`, `data_module.TASK`. No new search needed.

If running in standalone mode (no pipeline artifacts), note this limitation in each review and proceed with ungrounded evaluation.

### Step 0.5 -- Active Novelty Verification

> Query template: [`prompts/build_novelty_queries.md`](prompts/build_novelty_queries.md)
> Analysis template: [`prompts/build_novelty_analysis.md`](prompts/build_novelty_analysis.md)
> Configuration: [`references/novelty_verification_config.md`](references/novelty_verification_config.md)

Proactively search the literature to verify whether the idea (or key components) already exists. This step runs **before** persona reviews so all 3 reviewers have the prior art report as evidence.

**Sub-steps:**

**0.5a — Extract search queries** (LLM call using `build_novelty_queries.md`):
- Input: `selected_idea` + known `source_papers` (inspiration)
- Output: 4 search queries (core_method, problem_domain, key_component, broad_approach) + idea_summary + key_terms
- If query extraction fails, fall back to extracting queries from the idea title and key sentences

**0.5b — Execute searches** (4 invocations of `search_ai_papers.py`):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/searching-ai-papers/scripts/search_ai_papers.py \
  --query "<query>" --sources arxiv,semantic_scholar,openalex \
  --max-results 10 --year-from <current_year-3> --format json
```
- Run once per query (4 total)
- Collect all results and cross-deduplicate by title similarity
- If a search fails, log the error and proceed with available results
- If ALL searches fail, proceed with unverified novelty (set threat level to `unverified`)

**0.5c — Analyze similarity** (LLM call using `build_novelty_analysis.md`):
- Input: `selected_idea` + deduplicated search results + `source_papers` + idea_summary + key_terms
- Three-phase analysis: Triage → Deep Analysis → Synthesis
- Papers matching known inspiration sources are tagged `[INSPIRATION_SOURCE]`
- Output: Novelty Grounding Report with threat level assessment

**0.5d — Fast-fail check**:
- If threat level is `critical_overlap` on a non-inspiration paper AND `CRITICAL_OVERLAP_FAST_FAIL` is true:
  - Present the overlapping paper to the user
  - Offer choices: **Proceed** / **Refine** / **Abandon**
  - Record the user's decision in the JSON log
- If user chooses "Refine": return to idea generation with the overlapping paper as context
- If user chooses "Abandon": stop evaluation

**0.5e — Inject report into evidence**:
- The Novelty Grounding Report is included in evidence blocks for ALL 3 personas (regardless of evidence level)
- In standalone mode, this step still runs (search does not depend on pipeline artifacts)

**Save (txt first, then json)**:
1. Write the full report -> `Ideation/ideas/novelty_grounding_report.txt`
2. Build structured data with `report_text` copied verbatim from the `.txt` file
3. Write -> `Ideation/ideas/logs/idea_eval_agent_novelty.json`

For refinement re-runs, save as `novelty_grounding_report_v{N}.txt` and `idea_eval_agent_novelty_v{N}.json`.

### Steps 1-3 -- Three Persona Reviews (each in a NEW conversation)

> Full template: [`prompts/build_eval_query.md`](prompts/build_eval_query.md)
> Agent system prompt: [`references/eval_agent_instructions.md`](references/eval_agent_instructions.md)
> Persona definitions: [`references/reviewer_personas.md`](references/reviewer_personas.md)

For each persona (1=Senior ML Researcher, 2=Domain Expert, 3=Methods Specialist):
1. Build eval query using `prompts/build_eval_query.md` template with persona-specific evidence block from Step 0
2. Start a NEW conversation with the Eval Agent
3. The agent evaluates all 5 dimensions and produces structured scores

**Scoring Calibration** (from InnoEval):
- 9-10 (10%): Groundbreaking / paradigm-shifting
- 7-8 (25%): Strong contribution with clear novelty
- 5-6 (45%): Solid but incremental
- 3-4 (15%): Notable weaknesses
- 0-2 (5%): Fundamentally flawed

**Self-Discovery Check** (Novelty only): If a found paper appears identical to the idea, assume it IS the idea's inspiration source -- don't penalize.

**Save (txt first, then json)** after each persona:
1. Write the agent's full review -> `Ideation/ideas/eval_persona_{N}_review.txt`
2. Build structured scores JSON
3. Write -> `Ideation/ideas/logs/idea_eval_agent_persona_{N}.json`

### Step 4 -- Meta-Review

> Full template: [`prompts/build_meta_review_query.md`](prompts/build_meta_review_query.md)

Aggregate all 3 reviews. The agent acts as Area Chair:
- Computes average score per dimension across all personas
- Resolves reviewer disagreements (where scores differ by >3 points)
- Produces final recommendation

**Decision Thresholds**:

| Average Score | Decision | Action |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| >= 7.0 | `strong_accept` | Proceed to code survey |
| >= 6.0 | `accept` | Proceed to code survey |
| >= 5.0 | `borderline_accept` | Present report, ask user whether to proceed or refine |
| >= 4.0 | `borderline_reject` | Suggest refinement, ask user |
| < 4.0 | `reject` | Trigger refinement loop automatically |

**Save (txt first, then json)**:
1. Write the meta-review report -> `Ideation/ideas/eval_report.txt`
2. Build aggregated scores and decision
3. Write -> `Ideation/ideas/logs/idea_eval_agent_meta_review.json`

### Step 5 -- Quality Gate

- **Accept path** (`strong_accept` or `accept`): Pipeline continues to `inno-code-survey`. `selected_idea` passes through unchanged.
- **Borderline path** (`borderline_accept` or `borderline_reject`): Present evaluation report to user. Ask whether to proceed, refine, or abandon.
- **Reject path** (`reject`): Build structured feedback via `prompts/build_refinement_feedback_query.md`. Trigger refinement loop.

### Step 6 -- Refinement Loop (if triggered)

> Full template: [`prompts/build_refinement_feedback_query.md`](prompts/build_refinement_feedback_query.md)

1. Build structured feedback from all persona reviews (weaknesses + suggestions)
2. Append refinement prompt to the original idea generation conversation (from `inno-idea-generation`)
3. Idea Agent revises the idea (not generates new)
4. Save revised idea as `Ideation/ideas/refined_idea_v{N}.txt`
5. Re-run evaluation (Steps 1-4) on the refined idea
6. Maximum 2 refinement iterations before requiring user decision
7. If accepted after refinement, update `selected_idea.txt` and `final_selected_idea_data`

### Step 7 -- Output

Set `context_variables["idea_evaluation_result"]` with complete structured data:

```json
{
  "decision": "strong_accept|accept|...",
  "overall_avg": 0.0,
  "aggregated_scores": { "..." },
  "persona_reviews": [ "..." ],
  "report": "<full report text>",
  "novelty_verification": {
    "threat_level": "critical_overlap|high_overlap|moderate_overlap|low_overlap|novel",
    "genuine_novel_contributions": ["..."],
    "search_coverage": { "total_raw": 0, "total_unique": 0, "sources": ["..."] },
    "fast_fail_triggered": false,
    "user_decision": null
  },
  "refinement_iterations": 0,
  "grounded": true
}
```

If refinement occurred, also update:
- `Ideation/ideas/selected_idea.txt` with the refined idea
- `context_variables["final_selected_idea_data"]` with updated text

## Configuration

| Constant                     | Default | Description |
|------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `NUM_PERSONAS`               | 3       | Number of reviewer personas |
| `ACCEPT_THRESHOLD`           | 6.0     | Minimum avg score for automatic accept |
| `STRONG_ACCEPT_THRESHOLD`    | 7.0     | Minimum avg score for strong accept |
| `BORDERLINE_THRESHOLD`       | 5.0     | Minimum avg score before auto-reject |
| `REJECT_THRESHOLD`           | 4.0     | Below this triggers automatic refinement |
| `MAX_REFINEMENT_ITERATIONS`  | 2       | Maximum refinement attempts before user decision |
| `NUM_QUERIES`                | 4       | Search queries extracted from idea (Step 0.5) |
| `MAX_RESULTS_PER_QUERY`     | 10      | Results per query per source (Step 0.5) |
| `DEFAULT_SOURCES`            | `arxiv,semantic_scholar,openalex` | Search sources for novelty verification |
| `YEAR_WINDOW`                | 3       | Years back to search from current year |
| `CRITICAL_OVERLAP_FAST_FAIL` | `true`  | User checkpoint on critical overlap detection |
